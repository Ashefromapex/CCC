# CCC
a C Cli Calculator (short CCC) written as one of my first C projects

The calculator is able to correctly calculate a mathematical equation and even supports parentheses ('(') and absolute value of ('#') operations 

Currently there is a default and a function mode with more modes planned

To do:
- Add rest of the modes
- Clean up code
- more commands / implement unused ones
